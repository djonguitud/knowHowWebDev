				<h1>Form</h1>
				<!-- As you can see in the examples, it's common practice to wrap a label and its 
               widget with a <li> element within a <ul> or <ol> list. <p> and <div> elements are also commonly used. 
               Lists are recommended for structuring multiple checkboxes or radio buttons.

				   The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
               The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post). -->

				<form action="#" method="post">
					<ul>
						<!-- The <li> elements are there to conveniently structure our code and make styling easier  -->
						<li>
							<!-- 
                     With the <label> associated correctly with the <input> via its for attribute 
                     (which contains the <input> element's id attribute), it is considered best practice to set the for 
                     attribute to ensure all assistive technologies understand the relationship between label and widget.

                     If there is no label, or if the form control is neither implicitly nor explicitly associated with a label, 
                     a screen reader will read out something like "Edit text blank", which isn't very helpful at all.

                     There is great benefit to doing this â€” it associates the label with the form control, enabling mouse, trackpad, 
                     and touch device users to click on the label to activate the corresponding control, and it also provides an
                      accessible name for screen readers to read out to their users.
                     -->
							<label for="password"><span>Password</span></label>
							<input type="password" name="strong-password" id="password" required />
						</li>
						<li>
							<button type="submit">Submit</button>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</form>
